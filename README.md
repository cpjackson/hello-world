# hello-world
I have no memory of this place

I have allegedly studied Computer Science in the past. I like to analyze things, learn how things react to different influences, and try to understand how things progress through time.  I have recently been more interested in statistical analysis.  I guess I'll start by absorbing all the information I can about these sorts of things.
